##BLACKJACK

Blackjack, also known as twenty-one, where players dealt two cards, reaching a final score higher than the dealer without exceeding 21 win, is a comparing card game between usually several players and a dealer.

##Game Table

Players are each dealt two cards (face up). The dealer is also dealt two cards, one up (exposed) and one down (hidden)
Players are allowed to draw additional cars (HIT) or not draw (Stand) when the sum of the cards values is not exceeding 21.
Once all the players have completed their hands, the dealer then reveals the hidden card and must hit until the cards total 17 or more points. Points Calculation
Ace means 1 or 11 points
King, Queen, Jack are all worth ten
Other cards is their pip value (2 through 10) Blackjack
Get 21 points on the player’s first two card (called a “blackjack”), then players receive 1.5x of the bet. (1.5 to 1) Bust
When player’s hand exceeds 21 points, the player loses his bet. Push
If the player and dealer have the same total, it’s called a push. Stand
Take no more cards. For example, when player or dealer’s hand is more than 17 points, they may choose to stay. Hit
Take another card from the dealer. Surrender
When the player surrenders, the house takes half the player's bet and returns the other half to the player (only available as first decision of a hand) Insurance 
If the dealer’s upcard is an ace, the player is offered the option of taking “insurance”, the amount of which is half the size of player’s original bet.
When the dealer has blackjack, it pays 2:1 (meaning that the player receives two dollars for every dollar bet) 
When the dealer does not have blackjack, the player loses the insurance bet. Even Money
When dealer’s upcard is an ace, before player buying an insurance, Even Money is offered to a player with blackjack. In case the dealer has a blackjack, the player will push on the original bet and get a 2 to 1 payout on the even money side bet. In case the player does not choose Even Money, and the dealer has a blackjack, it’s a push.
